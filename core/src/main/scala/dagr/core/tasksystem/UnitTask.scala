 * - a task can depend on data from tasks on which it is dependent.  See [[Linker]].
 * - a task extending this class should return only one task in its getTasks method.  See [[Task.getTasks]].
 * - a task can perform any final logic dependent on the resources with which it is scheduled.  See [[Scheduler!.schedule*]].
  *
 * When a unit task gets scheduled, the [[Scheduler.schedule]] method will be called to allow any final
 * logic based on the resources this task was scheduled with.  This is in addition to the steps listed in [[Task]].
