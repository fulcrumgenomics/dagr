  * This collection is for arguments that require special treatment by the arguments parser itself.
  * It should not grow beyond a very short list.
  *
  * An arguments file will split apart by spaces, but all neighbouring strings without a leading
  * dash ('-') will be grouped.  Use multiple lines to ungroup the arguments
  *   Example 1:
  *   File: "--aab s --b -c -d wer we -c"
  *   Args: "--aab" "s" "--b" "-c" "-d" "wer we" "-c"
  *
  *   Example 2:
  *   File: "--aab s --b -c -d wer\nwe -c"
  *   Args: "--aab" "s" "--b" "-c" "-d" "wer", "we" "-c"
